Rapid Automatic Barrier
This is my first project at university. We created this project at 3 person. 
The purpose of our project was to create a prototype of Rapid Automatic Barier. 
This prototype must a work like a real construction of Barrier. Prototype has a following items: 
two distance sensors, one display and step motors, RFiD (Radio Frequency Identification System) 
It's a special system that allows to identify user. Every users must use a special unique card. 
First of all it must be opening when the car stands in front at the Barrier. Display shows a quantity 
of free places and message with you asking apply a card. If we don't have a free - display will show and 
Barier will not open. So the car drove through Barirer must be a following condition:

At least one free pleace
One of distans sensors must give a signal, in other words, car must be stand before Barier
The user must put a card to reader.
If this condition will be accepted - Barrier was open. In other words, 
the steps motors gets a signal and open Barrier for 90 degrees.

The second sensor give a signal while a car will no drive a safe distance. 
After this Barrier is closed. I attached a photo of our prototype, documentation in polish language and 
code with Arduino and Logo Soft Comfort.
